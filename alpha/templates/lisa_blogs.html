                        <p>What is Epilepsy?</p>
                        <p>Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Anyone can develop epilepsy.( www.mayoclinic.org › epilepsy › symptoms-causes › syc-20350093.) 
                                Epilepsy is a condition in which a person has recurrent seizures. A seizure is defined as an abnormal, disorderly discharging of the brain's nerve cells, resulting in a temporary disturbance of motor, sensory, or mental function. ... Episodes of abnormal electrical activity within the brain result in seizures. (www.emedicinehealth.com › epilepsy › article_em.)

                        <p>What happens during a seizure? </p>

                            <p> Beginning </p>
                                <p>Some people are aware of the beginning of a seizure, possibly as much as hours or days before it happens. On the other hand, some people may not be aware of the beginning and therefore have no warning.
                                Prodrome</p>

                                <p>Some people may experience feelings, sensations, or changes in behavior hours or days before a seizure. These feelings are generally not part of the seizure, but may warn a person that a seizure may come. Not everyone has these signs, but if they do, the signs can help a person change their activity, make sure to take their medication, use a rescue treatment, and take steps to prevent injury.</p>
                            <p>Aura</p>
                                <p>An aura or warning is the first symptom of a seizure and is considered part of the seizure. Often the aura is an indescribable feeling. Other times it’s easy to recognize and may be a change in feeling, sensation, thought, or behavior that is similar each time a seizure occurs.</p>
                                     The aura can also occur alone and may be called a focal onset aware seizure, simple partial seizure or partial seizure without change in awareness.
                                    • An aura can occur before a change in awareness or consciousness
                                    • Yet, many people have no aura or warning; the seizure starts with a loss of consciousness or awareness.
                                Common symptoms before a seizure
                                Awareness, Sensory, Emotional or Thought Changes
                                    •  Déjà vu (a feeling of being there before but never have)
                                    • Jamais vu (a feeling that something is very familiar but it isn’t)
                                    • Smells
                                    • Sounds
                                    • Tastes
                                    • Visual loss or blurring
                                    • “Strange” feelings
                                    • Fear/panic (often negative or scary feelings)
                                    • Pleasant feelings
                                    • Racing thoughts
                                Physical Changes
                                    • Dizzy or lightheaded
                                    • Headache
                                    • Nausea or other stomach feelings (often a rising feeling from the stomach to the throat)
                                    • Numbness or tingling in part of the body
                                Middle
                                The middle of a seizure is often called the octal phase. It’s the period of time from the first symptoms (including an aura) to the end of the seizure activity, this correlates with the electrical seizure activity in the brain. Sometimes the visible symptoms last longer than the seizure activity on an EEG. This is because some of the visible symptoms may be aftereffects of a seizure or not related to seizure activity at all.
                                Common symptoms during a seizure
                                Awareness, Sensory, Emotional or Thought Changes

                                    • Confused, feeling spacey
                                    • Periods of forgetfulness or memory lapses
                                    • Distracted, daydreaming
                                    • Loss of consciousness, unconscious, or “pass out”

                                    • Tremors, twitching or jerking movements (may occur on one or both sides of face, arms, legs or whole body; may start in one area then spread to other areas or stay in one place)
                                    • Rigid or tense muscles (part of the body or whole body may feel very tight or tense and if standing, may fall “like a tree trunk”)

                                        ◦ repeated movements of hands, like wringing, playing with buttons or objects in hands, waving
                                        ◦ dressing or undressing
                                        ◦ walking or running
                                    • Repeated purposeful movements (person may continue activity that was going on before the seizure)
                                    • Convulsion (person loses consciousness, body becomes rigid or tense, then fast jerking movements occur)
                                    • Losing control of urine or stool unexpectedly
                                    • Sweating

                                Ending
                                As the seizure ends, the postictal phase occurs - this is the recovery period after the seizure. Some people recover immediately while others may take minutes to hours to feel like their usual self. The type of seizure, as well as what part of the brain the seizure impacts, affects the recovery period – how long it may last and what may occur during it.

                        <p>Types of seizures
                                1. Generalized onset seizures: These seizures affect both sides of the brain or groups of cells on both sides of the brain at the same time. This term was used before and still includes seizures types like tonic-clonic, absence, or atonic to name a few.  
                             In a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure, the person will usually emit a short cry and fall to the floor. Their muscles will stiffen (tonic phase) and then their extremities will jerk and twitch (clonic phase). Bladder control may be lost. Consciousness is regained slowly.
                            After a seizure, the person may feel fatigue, confusion and disorientation. This may last from 5 minutes to several hours or even days. Rarely, this disorientation may last up to 2 weeks. The person may fall asleep, or gradually become less confused until full consciousness is regained.

                                2. Focal onset seizures: The term focal is used instead of partial to be more accurate when talking about where seizures begin. Focal seizures can start in one area or group of cells in one side of the brain.
                                    ◦ Focal Onset Aware Seizures: When a person is awake and aware during a seizure, it’s called a focal aware seizure. This used to be called a simple partial seizure. For better understanding click on the following link. https://youtu.be/8vISHhKCw_Q 
                                    ◦ Focal Onset Impaired Awareness: When a person is confused or their awareness is affected in some way during a focal seizure, it’s called a focal impaired awareness seizure. This used to be called a complex partial seizure. https://youtu.be/9X5fAg-FHpc
                            
                                3. Unknown onset seizures: When the beginning of a seizure is not known, it’s now called an unknown onset seizure. A seizure could also be called an unknown onset if it’s not witnessed or seen by anyone, for example when seizures happen at night or in a person who lives alone.
                            As more information is learned, an unknown onset seizure may later be diagnosed as a focal or generalized seizure.</p>

                                    Prior to the Seizure.
                                       1.) Do listen to the individual as some do get Auras; these are sensations that serve as a warning sign prior to the seizure.
                                       2.) Do help the individual get to a safe space as soon as they show signs of a seizure. This is to avoid any injury to the individual.
                                       3.) Do try and take note of the individual’s behavior or happenings during the Auras.
                                       4.) Do try and tilt the head to the side to avoid chocking.
                                   DURING THE SEIZURE.
                                       1.) Do turn their head to the side so that the foaming in the mouth oozes out to avoiding chocking. 
                                       2.) Do hold the gently to avoid injury and allow the seizure to take its full course. This means the seizure lasts lesser time.
                                       3.)  Do call their name so as to try helping him/her stay conscious of their surroundings. This helps overcome the seizure sometimes.
                                       4.) Do give the individual enough space for breathing and air circulation and ensure there are no harmful objects around.
                                       5.) Do turn the individual’s head to the side to avoid chocking on their saliva during the foaming in the mouth.
                                       6.) Do take note of how long the seizure(s) were. How long they lasted, was there more than one, and if so how long was the timing between them and how many there was.
                                       7.) Do rush the individual to the hospital for further treatment if seizure lasts more than 2 minutes.
                                       8.) Don’t give any food or drink during the seizures as they are unable to control themselves during that time.
                                       9.) Don’t put a spoon, stick, or any foreign object in the individual’s mouth as it heightens the chances of airway blockage which may lead to either chocking or suffocation.
                                   </p>
